Recall is a client for the Mnesia database system. It allows clients written
in languages other than Erlang to connect to and interact with Mnesia. 

== Protocol

The protocol Recall uses is very simple. It is based on JSON to make parsing
easy. Clients send commands to the Recall server encoded as a JSON array with
the first element in the array being the command to execute. The remaining 
elements in the array are the parameters to the command. The commands are
implemented in Erlang on the server and there is not currently a method for
executing Erlang code directly. 

A Recall command looks like this in JSON:

  ["COMMAND", "param1", "param2", "param3"]

Currently, the params can be strings, numbers or arrays. Support for objects
is planned but not currently implemented. 


== Command Reference

  ["CONNECT", "me@myhost"]

Establishes a connection to Recall. The second parameter is not used for
authentication purposes. It is mainly used to identify the client in a
troubleshooting situation. 

  ["ECHO", "text to echo"]

Sends the text in the parameter back to the client. It is primarily useful to
verify that the connection is working.

  ["MKTABLE", "table_name", ["field1", "field2", ...]]

Creates a new table in Mnesia. The first parameter is the name of the table
and the second is an array containing the field names. By convention the first
field is the key.

  ["RMTABLE", "table_name"]

Deletes the named table from Mnesia.

  ["INSERT", "table_name", ["value1", "value2" ...]]

Inserts a new record into the named table. Values must be supplied for all
fields in the table. Also, the field values must be in the same order as the
field names were in when the table was created.

  ["DELETE", "table_name", "key"]

Delete the record from the named table that is identified by the given key.
